  scale_fill_gradient(low="navy", high= "orange")+
  theme_minimal()
```

The overall trends of this graph show that the communities with a higher percentage people that identify as white tend to have lower CalEnviroScreen 3.0 scores. Alternatively, communities with a lower percentage of white community members tend to have higher CalEnviroScreen 3.0 scores.
